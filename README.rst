Cotiz-Counter
=============


This is a very simple python-flask to allow anyone to pay a fee at anytime.

If the fee is payed during the membership then the membership is prolonged from the end of the membership.

If not then a new adhesion starts at the date of the payement.

Pleaes note that this github is only a mirror for this project, the real home is http://redmine.rebattu.fr/projects/lpe-manager

Todo:
 * add mail reminders
 * add hall of shame
 * allow some configuration and a fee per user type (normal, unemployed, student)
